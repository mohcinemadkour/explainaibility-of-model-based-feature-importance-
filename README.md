# explainaibility-of-model-based-feature-importance-
Variable importance is central to scientific studies, including the social sciences and causal inference, healthcare, and other domains. However, explainability of variable importance is lacking. This is problematic: what if there were multiple well-performing predictive models, and a specific variable is important to some of them and not to others? In that case, we may not be able to tell from a single well-performing model whether a variable is always important in predicting the outcome. In order to circumvent that issue feature importance obtained from the model being trained can be explained using bayesian linear model
